##  Some use cases

* Background data synchronization
* Responding to resource requests from other origins
* Receiving centralized updates to expensive-to-calculate data such as geolocation or gyroscope, so multiple pages can make use of one set of data
* Hooks for background services
* Custom templating based on certain URL patterns
* Performance enhancements, for example pre-fetching resources that the user is likely to need in the near future, such as the new few pictures in a photo album.
